# Building Modern Web Applications with React and TypeScript

In this guide, we walk through setup, component best-practices, and tips for both beginners and advanced devs. You'll learn to create complex, yet robust, web apps faster than ever. Featuring:
- Creating a new project
- Prop types and interfaces
- Common error handling

\`\`\`bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
\`\`\`

## Why TS?  
Because catching bugs at compile time > at runtime.

## Final thoughts  
Type safety and DX FTW!
